## Fencing inventory management system

A C++ inventory management system for fencing equipment with SQLite database and web UI, inspired by my younger years of competitive fencing...

-> coming from a retired college varsity women's epee team fencer :0

but this is mostly because I wanted to practice/get better at C++ and SQL lol
